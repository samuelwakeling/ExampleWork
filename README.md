# Hello

This is a repo to store some examples of my work for potential employment. 

These projects represent personal projects, often done with limited time and on a 'get things done' basis. They were never intended to be published, but seeing I can't provide examples of my actual work, this is the next best thing. 

If you aren't and employer, and are instead thinking of using the code for your own project, feel free to.

Enjoy, 
Sam
