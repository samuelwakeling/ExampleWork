# Hello

This is a repo to store some examples of my work. The main motivation being so that employers can see examples of work I have done.

These projects represent personal projects, often done with limited time and on a 'get things done' basis.

If you aren't and employer, and are instead thinking of using the code for your own project, feel free to.

Enjoy, 
Sam
